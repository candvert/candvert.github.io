You can name it, you have control over it.
## 设计的四个基本原则
1. Proximity
Group related items together.
The proximity, or the closeness, implies a relationship.
2. Alignment
Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page.
Find a strong alignment and stick to it.
The basic purpose of alignment is to unify and organize the page.
Avoid using more than one text alignment on the page (that is, don’t center some text and right-align other text).
3. Repetition
Repetition can be thought of as consistency.
The purpose of repetition is to unify and to add visual interest.
If there is a consistent, repetitive starting point at the top of the page.
The great thing about repetition is that it makes items look like they belong together, even if the elements are not exactly the same.
The repetitive element does not have to be a graphic or clipart. It can be spacing, rules, fonts, alignments, or anything that you consciously repeat.
4. Contrast
Contrast on a page draws our eyes to it; our eyes like contrast.
Contrast is crucial to the organization of information—a reader should always be able to glance at a document and instantly understand what’s going on.
If the items are not exactly the same, make them different!


## color wheel
**primary colors:** red, yellow and blue

**secondary colors:** green, purple, orange (equal yellow and blue make green; equal blue and red make purple; equal red and yellow make orange)
![[1000045698.png]]
**tertiary colors:** mix equal parts of the colors on each side

Colors directly across from each other, exact opposites, are complements. Because they’re so opposite, they often work best when one is the main color and the other is an accent.

A set of three colors equidistant from each other always creates a triad of pleasing colors. Red, yellow, and blue is an extremely popular combination for children’s products. Because these are the primary colors, this combination is called the primary triad.





Another form of a triad is the split complement. Choose a color from one side of the wheel, find its complement directly across the wheel, but use the colors on each side of the complement instead of the complement itself. This creates a combination that has a little more sophisticated edge to it.

An analogous combination is composed of those colors that are next to each other on the wheel. No matter which two or three you combine, they all share an undertone of the same color, creating a harmonious combination.

The pure color is the hue.
Add black to a hue to create a shade.
Add white to a hue to create a tint.

Colors tend to be either on the warm side (which means they have some red or yellow in them) or on the cool side (which means they have some blue in them). You can “warm up” certain colors, such as grays or tans, by adding more reds or yellows to them. Conversely, you can cool down some colors by adding various blues to them.
The most practical thing to remember is that cool colors recede into the background, and warm colors come forward. It takes very little of a hot color to make an impact—reds and yellow jump right into your eyes. So if you’re combining hot colors with cool, generally use less of the hot color.
